# Planner-app

This is a basic day planner that loops through the hours of 9am - 6pm for a specific date. The application allows the user to plan and keep track of their work day.

## Usage

Enter an event in any field. The data will be saved to the Local Storage of the browser. The past hours are highlighted gray, the current hour red, and future hours green. The events will still appear even if the browser is refreshed. Clear the Local Storage memory to erase events.
